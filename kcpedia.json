This is understandable due to the virtually unlimited amount of finger position options that can be chosen during a song. However, the left hand does not play without the right hand - the \u201cconductor\u201d of the instrument. Different techniques for the right hand dictate the capabilities of the left hand and develop sonorities by themselves.\r\n\r\nThe crosspicking technique is a picking technique mostly established in bluegrass music - a genre of acoustic music, mostly as a plucked, recurring and syncopated rhythm crossing strings. However, cross picking can be understood in more fundamental concepts that are cross genre. In this article we will go through some of the most popular crosspicking techniques, whom pioneered them and the crossed influence of different music genres on the jazz guitar world."},{"id":2210191,"type":"exposition","title":"The influence of Scarlatti Sonatas in the evolution of  the Classical Sonata","thumb":"https://media.researchcatalogue.net/rc/cache/d2/87/f6/6c/d287f66c127165a46d795a848c9f9689.png?t=147bdfb12950bd484709c623a1e5b249&e=1713618300","default-page":"https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/2210191/2210190","meta-data-page":"https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=2210191","keywords":["Domenico Scarlatti","Sonata","kcpedia"],"created":"19/06/2023","last-modified":"19/06/2023","status":"progress","doi":{"id":null,"url":null},"published":null,"published_in":[],"license":"cc-by-nc-nd","issue":null,"author":{"id":1767109,"name":"Lara \u0160ac"},"coauthors":[],"abstract":"Although it has its roots before, the sonata started to develop in the late Baroque era, mainly in the time of Domenico Scarlatti, who composed 555 keyboard sonatas.

Most likely, after humans figured our percussion, they blew across reeds to make sounds. And so the flute was born. They are an instrument shrouded in mystery and ritual, but that is not what this text will be focusing on. Rather I would like to ask the question how we went from making flutes out of the bones of animals, to wood and today to using precious metals such as gold and silver? What makes this material so much better than the wood that had been the standard for hundreds of years, even though it arguably is much more difficult to acquire? In this text I will explore the different materials used throughout history for the European Flutes, and when and why it changed."},{"id":1599905,"type":"exposition","title":"Eastern European Gypsy Music","thumb":null,"default-page":"https://www.researchcatalogue.net/view/1599905/1599904","meta-data-page":"https://www.researchcatalogue.net/profile/show-exposition?exposition=1599905","keywords":["kcpedia","Romanian Folk Music"],"created":"15/04/2022","last-modified":"13/06/2018","status":"progress","doi":{"id":null,"url":null},"published":null,"published_in":[],"license":"cc-by-nc-nd","issue":null,"author":{"id":1557282,"name":"W.A.W."},"coauthors":[],"abstract":"A research about Eastern European gypsy music."}]}
