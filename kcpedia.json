Although still largely based on models of recorders available in the 18th century, the low quality of the mass-produced instruments is often the reason the recorder is viewed as a toy, making the material key to the public's perception of the instrument."

They are an instrument shrouded in mystery and ritual, but that is not what this text will be focusing on. Rather I would like to ask the question how we went from making flutes out of the bones of animals, to wood and today to using precious metals such as gold and silver? What makes this material so much better than the wood that had been the standard for hundreds of years, even though it arguably is much more difficult to acquire? In this text I will explore the different materials used throughout history for the European Flutes, and when and why it changed."

However, there is a clear inclination towards alveolar consonants [t], [r], [d] and [l] in sources from the 18th Century, leaving the velar consonants aside.\r\n\r\nThis article explores and explains the articulation of the 18th century, until we find the return of the velar consonants ([k]/[q]-[g]) and their expansion in the 19th century."

It is in the educational context, at the Royal Conservatoire in The Hague, that I had my first contact with performing Schubert\u2019s music and, more specifically, his songs: pairing up with a singer as a pianist was a new experience for me, and it has proved to be incredibly enriching, stimulating new kinds of questions and making me see music and think about it from a different point of view. In particular, I got the chance to study and perform some songs from Schubert\u2019s last published song cycle, Winterreise, and started looking at my different possibilities as a performer in light of historical documentation, specifically on the correct performance of some passages concerning tempo fluctuations and dynamics. To find answers to these questions, I have turned to historical sources about piano playing (especially the treatises of Czerny, C.P.E. Bach and Turk) as well as current musicological research, hoping they would provide some guidance."
